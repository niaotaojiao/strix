## Introduction

This theme was originally created for my personal job-hunting website.  
While there are plenty of excellent templates available for **Hugo**, I never felt comfortable with the Go ecosystem (and, no offense, its mascot doesn’t really appeal to me).  

On the other hand, **Zola** is a lightweight and elegant static site generator that I truly enjoy using — yet I found most existing Zola themes visually uninspiring.  
So I decided to build one myself: something clean, modern, and flexible, reflecting both my design taste and the practical needs of a personal site.

## Demo

🚧 A demo site is not available yet — it’s still under development.  
Stay tuned! I’ll add the live preview link once the theme reaches its first stable release.

## Who It’s For

This theme is designed with simplicity and individuality in mind.  
It’s perfect for:

- 📝 **Bloggers** who prefer minimal aesthetics with readable typography  
- 💼 **Portfolio creators** who want a professional yet personal presentation  
- 👤 **Individuals** looking to build a personal landing page or profile

This post marks the beginning of a small documentation series where I’ll explain the theme’s structure, customization options, and development notes in detail.  
If you’re curious about how it’s built, or plan to fork it for your own use — you’re in the right place.
